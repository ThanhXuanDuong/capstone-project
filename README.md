# medView
A medical image viewer and management app 

## Description
medView is a medical clinic application that provides an effective solution for organizing and managing patient data along with their medical images. 
Its integrated features assist physicians in documenting diagnoses with ease. 
This app was created in 4 weeks during my participation in a Java full-stack coding boot camp as a capstone project.
